------> Template Inheritance

    - When a child template inherits a parent template, the parent template gets access to it's context and request object.
    - In order for the child template to add additional content apart from what a base template offers, blocks need to be
        created in parent template. Child template can write it's content inside the same block.
    - eg:
        > base.html
            <body>
                <h1>Hello from parent</h1>

                {% block content %}
                    <p>this is default content provided by parent</p>
                {% endblock content %}
            </body>

        > home.html (inherits base)
            {% extends 'base.html' %}

            {% block content %}
                <p>Hello there, Jayanti</p>
            {% endblock content %}

        The default content provided by parent inside the block 'content' gets overridden by child template.
        The blocks are needed to be named as there can be multiple blocks inside a single file.


    - In case you don't want to override but actually combine the contents of both parent and child:
        > home.html (inherits base)
            {% extends 'base.html' %}

            {% block content %}
                <p>Hello there, Jayanti</p>
                {{ block.super }}
            {% endblock content %}
            
        Doing block.super will fetch and append the parent's content as well.
